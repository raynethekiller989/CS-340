How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- To develop software that is easy to maintain, read, and adapt, I focus on creating modular and transferable code. For instance, the CRUD module used in Project Three can be seamlessly integrated into Project One and Project Two for reading, updating, and deleting database records. This modular approach enhances productivity and ensures that applications can be easily debugged and updated.
  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  - To approach software development with a computer scientist's mindset, I rely on critical thinking. I begin by analyzing the challenge at hand, thoroughly understanding the requirements, and evaluating various solutions to determine the most effective approach. From there, I create test cases with clear pass and fail criteria for each requirement. Using these test cases, I develop tools to address the challenge, implement the tests, and debug the application as needed. I will continue applying this method to ensure the development of high-quality applications and software.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
- Computer scientists identify challenges, analyze them, and test their solutions—a crucial process for developing high-quality, user-friendly software for clients. Without actively seeking solutions, there’s no opportunity for learning and growth. Modular software development provides long-term advantages for companies, allowing for interchangeable and reusable modules. This approach saves time and resources for businesses like Grazioso Salvare, streamlining development and implementation.
